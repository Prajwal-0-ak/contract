If the payment model is based on 'per task,' 'per unit,' or 'per transaction' (e.g., 'per SKU,' 'per batch') then it is 'Transaction Based'. If it's based on 'per FTE' (Full-Time Equivalent), such as 'per FTE per hour' or 'per FTE per month' then it is 'FTE Based'. per keyword corresponds to Transaction Based and FTE corresponds to FTE Based."
